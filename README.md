# Happiness Detector Project

Many companies today use Computer Vision in their core business
to detect emotions. For example, Apple recently bought Emotient, a
startup that builds Computer Vision tools to recognize people's
feelings<br><br>
Building an AI that sees emotions can be highly valuable in some
markets. Imagine if you could detect people's emotions when they
are watching movies. That would have a powerful impact on the
cinema industry and bring significant added value to companies
like Netflix or Time Warner for which you could build powerful
recommender systems based on Computer Vision applications able
to understand emotions.
<br><br><b>
Therefore, built a Computer Vision application that can detect one emotion: happiness.</b>
